### TOR vs CLE

**Prop bet; 20u; DraftKings 6:15pm ET; -327 (L)**

*  **Dean Wade 1+ 3s made**

Admittedly, I think I got Sam Merrill and Dean Wade mixed up. This was a massive L especially as I realized Wade was closer to a 6’ 10” backup center than he was a prototypical 6’ 5” NBA 3&D wing. 



# ATL vs UTA

**Prop bet; 30u; DraftKings 8:28pm ET; -130 (W)**

*  **Ace Bailey 12+ points**

I knew Ace Bailey would get his with a start against what seemed to be a very evenly matched team, and I thought the line was underpriced when I saw it. This line hit with plenty to spare. 

Ace Bailey, as he had been projected for several years now, is on pace to be one of the top players in his class not only this year but also in many years to come. He plays with grace and patience, with a playstyle that can continue to mature and develop even as the youthful physical assets begin to regress. I think that Jazz fans and the organization itself must be relieved, even in light of a tough loss against the Hawks, given that Bailey is everything that they could’ve hoped for and possibly more, and it makes his selection at number 5 all the more a steal. 


# IND vs PHX

* **no bets placed**
