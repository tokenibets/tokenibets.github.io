## MIA vs NYK

Injuries to Bam/Herro as usual, Brunson out with ankle. NYK -6.0.

The Knicks added Jordan Clarkson in the off-season to help with shooting off the bench. Otherwise, they’ll have Mr. Mikal Bridges running point. If he wasn’t ever trusted to run point in Phoenix with Chris Paul running point over Devin Booker, then why does anyone ever think Bridges can run point in NY? All that to say is that the Knicks are going to be playing scared basketball, and I genuinely don’t believe OG and KAT can play good enough in iso to carry the Knicks to a 6-point win. 

The Heat on the other hand have been steamrolling opponents including the Lakers. Norman Powell to me looks like a top-5 shooting guard in the NBA. I mean you could argue for maybe Ant, Book, and a couple other names, but Norman Powell Is definitely up there. Then you have Davion Mitchell who plays solid defense and has the ability to get the ball to other players. JJJ, Pelle Larsson, Fontecchio are all-around wings with no glaring weaknesses, and Ware is a monster in the paint especially in rebounding. 

With Mitchell Robinson on a minutes restriction, will Kolek get some minutes? He barely got time last year, which means his development might be slightly arrested. The game script will be, the Knicks have KAT post up and try to facilitate a little, and Mikal will throw up much more contested threes than normal. Brick city all around, and you’ll have defensive rebounding at higher rates for the Heat guards/wings. 

Maybe Josh Hart has a bigger role this game as he likely takes the start over Brunson. His hustle wil probably be crazy– maybe take the over on his rebounds because like I said, it’ll be brick city from the Knicks without Brunson to facilitate. The Heat on the other hand can rely on Davion Mitchell to run set plays, with Powell there to take the last shot. KAT will probably chuck the three early in the shot clock if he’s nervous without Brunson, and then take a huge backseat when things don’t fall. 

Either way, three props look good to me. Josh Hart over rebounds – maybe 5.5 is a good line to tackle. KAT under on points if he’s priced around 28.5. And then Ware over on rebounds, maybe 8.5 is a good line. 

Upon reviewing the lines, I forgot to mention Deuce McBride, who likely gets the nod ahead Hart. But again, is he really a good facilitator? He doesn’t have the lower body/core strength to bully himself into the paint, where Brunson can get to for drive-and-kick sets. If he passes slot to slot to KAT or Bridges, what’s to stop one of the Heat wings to just aggressively close out? I’d also fade Deuce assists, if inflated at 6.5.

KAT O/U 25.5 points
Hart O/U 7.5 reb
Ware O/U10.5 reb

Now, I’m looking at these lines, which have my predictions totally priced in. I think that Wiggins will be the focal point of the Knicks’ defense, as he’s made 2 or more threes for the past six games. I think Norman Powell can and will catch fire against his defensive matchup, which will include Jordan Clarkson and Deuce McBride, neither of whom are likely any good against Norman Powell. 

Powell can like score 4+ 3s this game. His O/U is at 2.5 3s; attacking this with a high unit prop bet will be extremely profitable according to my theorized game script. I’ll also put in a small parlay that takes my prior lines, even if these are inflated to my expectations.  


**PROP 12u; -159; 6:30pm ET, DraftKings**

*  **Norman Powell O 2.5 3s made**



**PARLAY 0.5u; +625; 6:30pm ET, DraftKings**

*  **KAT U 25.5 pts**

*  **Ware O 10.5 reb**

*  **Hart O 7.5 reb**












## BKN vs ORL

ORL -14.5. Injuries to Cam Thomas and Banchero. 

The Nets are the sorriest team in the NBA. They run plays like horns and motion, which, if you’re going up against a random D3 school, then great. Otherwise, it just looks so outdated and mediocre in the modern NBA, which relies more on zoom action and outside shooting. Yes, if your big men can’t shoot, just post them on the top of the key and run PnR off dribble hand-off, and Claxton is talented without a doubt. But when you see Okongwu and Markkanen in last night’s game each putting up several 3PT shots at ridiculous rates, it becomes clear that the Nets haven’t kept up. As a team, the Nets shoot poorly from 3, and they lack a true point guard in the likes of Shai, Brunson, or Luka, who can get to the paint, draw doubles/triples, and distribute off of the collapsed defense.

All that to say however is that the Nets will get blown out by the Magic, who will run through Bane and Franz, with their high-hustle bench pieces in Black, Suggs, and Isaac. Any bet will be entirely dependent on how effectively MPJ can shoot the Nets back into the game.

Though I am reluctant to bet anything at all, all signs point to Demin being the focal point of the Nets; after all, he was their lottery pick. Better to force him to play in tough spots so he can adjust and adapt, is the concept the Nets will be buying. I’d expect him bring the ball up the court and pass, where the Nets can expect to take some good looks from three. 


**PROP 1u; +240; 6:45pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Demin 3+ ast first quarter**



## PHI vs DET

DET -1.5. Injuries Embiid/PG; Cade, Duren, Ausar, Tobias Harris, Marcus Sasser, Ivey

I’m not sure why the moneyline and spread favor the Pistons when the 76ers lost to the Pistons by only 3, and that was when Cade played. Can Ron Holland and Caris LeVert really beat a talented 76ers backcourt of Maxey, Grimes, and Edgecombe? Duncan Robinson as their leading average scorer with 12ppg? 

Maxey is too talented the Pistons are without their top players. Paul Reed had a monster game against the Bulls but his props are nowhere to be found. This is a rare game where I would simply bet ML instead of any prop, simply because I find the market to be outrageously wrong. 


**ML 5u; -105; 7:10pm ET DraftKings**

*  **76ers ML**



## POR vs HOU


HOU -7.5. Healthy starters. 

Without getting into the nitty gritty, this is a prime spot for Avidja to break out for 32+ points. This is because the Rockets, outside of Amen Thompson, do not have players with the lateral quickness and lower body strength to match Avdija as he goes downhill. POR has plenty of positional size, enough to match the Rockets. Sengun and Thompson will be expected to playmake, but I would put heavy trust on Jrue to lock up Amen the whole game. Given how both teams are looking to be playoff contenders, I would think Avidja gets 35+ minutes this game. Avdija PRA also looks nice as when he is doubled, he has the intellect and vision to pass to Clingan on the inside of Sharpe on the outside. 


**PROP 5u; -114; 7:45pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Avdija O 34.5 PRA**




## CHA vs MIL

Injuries: Kalkbrenner. MIL -9.5. 

This will be likely a defining matchup for both the Hornets and the Bucks. Are the Hornets contenders with Kon and a healthy LaMelo? Is Giannis elite at the level where no team can stop him?

I think that Kon should be able to have a monster game with LaMelo healthy. They are both players that benefits from each other, as they provide spacing and passing lanes for one another. With such synergy, and also the fact that Milwaukee’s guard/wing defense consists of Gary Trent AJ Green and Ryan Rollins, my thesis is further emboldened by this. 

 
**PROP 3u; -109; 7:50pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Knueppel O 24.5 PRA**





## LAL vs NOP

Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears will both get 25+ minutes, and score 10+ points each. I think that markets will underprice LaRavia, though that is still TBD. And Rui first basket/first bucket will be in play. 


**PROP; 1u; +1960; 7:55pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Hachimura 3PFG– first scorer type**


**PARLAY; 0.5u; +340; 7:55pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Derik Queen 25+ PRA**
*  **Jeremiah Fears 25+ PRA**




## SAC vs MIN

With both sides rather healthy, I think that Jaden McDaniels will dictate the outcome, tempering the scoring of both LaVine and DeRozan. Given that the Kings will miss against this tough defender, I would go over on Gobert rebounds as he will find more defensive rebounds off of misses. Another bet would be a monster performance on Sabonis. With so much on the line, and with the better defense on the other players, there is little chance that Sabonis puts up a stinker. 


**PROP; 2u; -112; 8pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Sabonis O 32.5 PRA**



## LAC vs DAL

Kawhi, Beal, PJ, AD out.

In the past 5 games, Harden has put up 25/6/9 on about 43/40/93 shooting. Flagg on the other hand has averaged 16/7/4 on 43/29/74 shooting. If the Clippers want to win, then their best option is to put the ball in Harden’s hand and let him run the whole game. The Mavs on the other hand do not have a reliable facilitator– who will it be between Max Christie, D’Lo, or Naji Marshall?

This game will go just iso back and forth, but I have strong reason to think that Flagg will struggle against John Collins. It may ultimately devolve into foul-baiting, however, with Flagg getting calls and letting him dominate. 

Ultimately, I think that the safest theory to run with is to go over on Max Christie props, as he is showing flashes of huge potential on the offensive end. Even if it devolves into garbage time, Max will get minutes against Cam Christie, his own brother. 




**PROP 5u; -119; 8:30pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Cam Christie O 17.5 PRA**


## GSW vs SAS

I’ve been seeing Draymond hit the unders a lot recently, but matter of fact he is a very capable all-around player who just happened to miss a lot of shots in a bad game. Matter of fact, it’s very likely his numbers regress upwards and he makes several threes and a couple layups, making the PRA total a steal. With the projection for him to be making at least one three this game, O/U 19.5 PRA, assuming he gets 5ast, 5 reb, means he just needs to score 6 more points or just hustle a bit more. I think the Spurs will be none the wise and let Draymond shoot, whose reputation as a serviceable basketball player will either be kept or be broken in this critical juncture of NBA basketball. 


**PROP; 5u; -104; 8:45pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Draymond Green O 19.5 PRA**
