### TOR vs CLE

Notable injuries include Darius Garland, Lonzo Ball, with Mamu and CMB both questionable to play.

In my view, the Cavs have proven to be run through Jarrett Allen more so than Donovan Mitchell or Darius Garland. In their recent win against a well-qualified Heat team, Allen put up 30/10/2, while De’Andre Hunter followed with 21/6/2 and Craig Porter Jr. with 19/4/9. 

The Raptors’ starting center in Poeltl must match Allen to keep this game competitive. RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, and Brandon Ingram seem to me as one-dimensional scorers with decent positional size and average-to-mediocre defense. Their star in Scottie Barnes is built in the likes of hyper-athletic forwards such as Giannis and LeBron, though his decision-making is subpar at best.

Cavs come in at -7.5 favorites, with the OU at 238.5; this indicates a potentially high scoring affair. In terms of matchups, I think that Don–Quickley; Hunter–Barrett; Ingram–Mobley; Allen–Poeltl; and Wade–Barnes is likely.

 Mobley will likely find ways to shut down plays both inside and outside the arc, limiting the midrange potential of Ingram; likewise, Poeltl will have to work for every last rebound and point against Allen. Quickley and Mitchell will both go at each, neither one able to fully shut down the other, while Barrett and Hunter provide spot up shooting and some ability to go downhill. Scottie Barnes will be met with the scrappy 3&D wing in Wade, who will be tasked more with defensive assignments and boxing out than handling the ball and creating opportunities. 

Larry Nance and Craig Porter can provide some minutes off the bench, while Gradey Dick and Jamal Shead slot in to facilitate and take shots.

Advanced stats indicate that Scottie Barnes and De’Andre will be the weak links defensively. This would mean the possibility for Barrett to score 20+ points in some cases, and for Wade to find the net off the catch. With how Barrett is averaging 20 ppg so far this season while Dean Wade only averages 6, Wade’s line might be a softer pick. Seeing that the majority of Wade’s attempts are from 3, going O 0.5 3s made for Wade will be the correct play, also in considering that Hunter and Don have been shooting poorly as of late. Wade will find a way to stick on the floor for 25+ minutes to provide defensive opportunities, which should be rewarded in the form of catch and shoot 3s on the other end.

O 1.5 3s made for Wade is a little rich though at certain odds, it will remain a plus EV play. 


Update:

As of 5:50pm ET on DK, the line is set at O/U 1.5 3s, with O at +134 and U at -178. Implied odds are 43%. 

His last game against the Raptors ended up in poor shooting, 1-5 3PT. However, his past two games indicate he has found better rhythm, at 5-8 3PT. 

This play is viable if and only if the Raptors decide to fade the Dean Wade matchup and hunt through screens to find a better opponent. In such cases, which would be wise for the Raptors to implement, Wade finds himself playing more off-ball and away from the ball action, which should revolve around Immanuel Quickley hunting for mismatches and distributing the ball for easy looks, which generally don’t involve Wade on defense as much. Thus, Wade will find himself less exhausted through defense – though his presence is necessary as a kind of insurance or deterrence – and he can comfortably shoot 3s without having been exhausted. 

Taking 1+ 3s for Wade at -313 odds seems uncomfortable to stomach, but still should hit in most cases. At 75% implied odds, I think it is fairly or possibly priced.
