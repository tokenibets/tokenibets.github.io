### CHA vs MIL (**MIL -2.5**)

Notable injuries include **LaMelo Ball** and **Giannis**.
Charlotte will run a core of **Kon**, **Miles Bridges**, **Collin Sexton**, and **Kalkbrenner**, with **Sion**, **Tre Mann**, and **Pat Connaughton** rotating through for spot up 3 point shooting.
Milwaukee will likely run through **Myles Turner**, **Bobby Portis**, and **Kyle Kuzma** to score the ball, with **Gary Trent Jr.** and **AJ Green** providing 3pt shooting and **Ryan Rollins** and **Cole Anthony** sporting an elevated role as point guard.

With little in the way of an above-average point guard for the **Bucks**, I anticipate that **Kuzma**, **Portis**, and **Turner** will take turns going downhill. This elevates the floor for defensive rebounding from the **Hornets** – **Kalkbrenner** and **Miles Bridges** should see **8+ rebounds**.
**Kon** and **Miles Bridges** will lead the Hornets in scoring, though **Collin Sexton** may find room to produce offensively with **AJ Green**, **Rollins**, or **Trent** guarding, all of whom are below average defenders. We can safely expect **15+ points** from **Sexton** in this scenario.

Game script will depend on how effectively the **Bucks** can find the bucket from **3**; this will be something the **Hornets** will target, however. Given **Kalkbrenner’s** boxing-out abilities, we can also assume high rebounding numbers off of 3pt misses from the Bucks.

I am confident that **Kalkbrenner** will record **8+ rebounds**, which will be the main prop at **1–3u**. Then, to hedge against it, we will assume the Bucks and also **Sexton** find rhythm offensively, thus we can go **4+ 3s** from **Trent Jr.**, **O 17.5** for **Sexton**, and **O 4.5 assists** for **Rollins** in a parlay at **0.25u**.

Notes on actual lines:
**Collins o/u 16.5 points**, **Rollins o/u 6.5 ast**. Instead go **O 4.5 Anthony ast**, as I do not see the Bucks relying so much more on Rollins than Anthony to justify the line. **Knueppel’s line o/u 3.5 ast** also seems extremely low and I believe the Bucks will plan to shut **Knueppel** down in scoring, leading to his increased facilitation.

**O/U for Kalkbrenner set at 7.5**, which seems soft compared to my prediction. Go **3u** given high confidence.

**Prop; 3u; +107; 6:45 ET on DK**
**Kalkbrenner O 7.5 reb**

**Parlay; 0.25u; +1200; 6:45 ET on DK**

* **Gary Trent Jr. 4+ 3s made**
* **O 3.5 Knueppel ast**
* **O 4.5 Anthony ast**
* **O 16.5 Sexton pts**

### DET vs CHI (**CHI -1.5**)

Notable injuries include **Cade Cunningham**, **Ausar Thompson**, **Josh Giddey**, **Isaiah “Beef Stew” Stewart**, **Coby White**.

**Pistons** will run through **Caris LeVert**, **Duncan Robinson**, and even **Jalen Duren** to facilitate. None of them are proven to be able to find sharp passes through traffic for 3 point looks. Expect **lower scoring overall** and **higher points in the paint** for **Duren**, **Javonte Green**, and **Paul Reed**.

**Tre Jones** will run point for the **Bulls** without **Giddey**; **Ayo Dosunmu** is back to form after a lifted minutes restriction though **Matas Buzelis** has shown flashes. Depending on sportsbook lines, I would lean towards **Dosunmu PRA** props as well as **Kevin Huerter 3FGM** as the opposing **Duncan Robinson** will likely struggle.

**Nikola Vucevic** and **Duren** will likely both get **double-doubles** in this lower-scoring affair as shots fail to convert.

Given the injuries, it is difficult to project exactly how the coaches will distribute minutes. Therefore, only a highly speculative **0.1u parlay** is warranted in this case, with a slightly bigger parlay for **double-doubles of Vuc and Duren**.

Note: **Duren is now considered out** for the game. **Vuc DD** is still live, though I expect the **Bulls** to run away with the game easily. Now considering **Buzelis PR over** due to garbage time possibilities, and **over on Duncan Robinson 3FGM** as he must chuck **7+ 3s** to keep the game competitive.

**Parlay; 0.1u; +166; 7:15pm on DK (live game parlay)**

* **Huerter 2+ 3s**
* **Buzelis O 19.5 PR**

### NYK vs ORL

With very few injuries on either side, this will be a closely run game, **Knicks -4.0**.

**Mitchell Robinson** minutes restriction to note; **Jalen Brunson** will likely struggle against the defensively minded **ORL** backcourt. More will be relegated to **Mikal Bridges** and **Karl-Anthony Towns (KAT)** to rain from three (**2+ 3s each**).

**ORL** will run the game through **Paolo Banchero**, who should see around **28/8/4**, or **40+ PRA**. Help will be needed from outside shooting however; taking the **over on Franz Wagner 3FGM** will be a wise call as **ORL** coaches must make him shoot to open up the game.

**Desmond Bane** will likely struggle against **Bridges/OG Anunoby**, though **Wendell Carter Jr.** will likely find himself with more rebounding opportunities against **KAT**.

**Parlay; 0.1u; +1800; 7pm DK**

* **Bridges O 1.5 3s made**
* **Bane U 16.5 pts**
* **Wendell Carter Jr. O 7.5 reb**
* **Franz O 1.5 3s**
* **KAT O 1.5 3s**

### BOS vs MEM (**-8.5 BOS**)

**Boston** are heavily favored against the **Grizzlies**, who likely are resting **Ja Morant** off a back to back.

This game will likely be dictated within the first two quarters; without **Ja**, **MEM** needs **Jaren Jackson Jr. (JJJ)** to step up as a scorer and facilitator which is a tall task. **Coward** and **Santi Aldama** do not face anyone who can reliably block their 3 point attempts; thus **over on their 3s** is crucial to add as they also will be asked to take **4+ 3s** this game.

**Jaylen Brown** is still expected to perform despite the likelihood of the blowout, though betting on him with any confidence is a fool’s errand.

Thus a **2-leg 3s made parlay** including **Coward** and **Aldama** at around **0.5u** is most reasonable.

**Parlay; 0.5u; +184; 7:25pm DK**

* **Aldama O 1.5 3s**
* **Coward O 1.5 3s**

---

### MIA vs CLE (**-4.5 MIA**)

Notable injuries include **Darius Garland (DG)**, **Max Strus**, **Evan Mobley**, and **Donovan Mitchell**; **Bam Adebayo** on the **Heat**.

Without the top players on the **Cavs**, **Hunter** will be asked to take **8+ 3s**; **4+ 3s for Hunter** is the main bet, though still rich. I also expect **Norman Powell** to score less as his teammates have more of an opportunity to shine; **JJJ**, **Nikola Jovic**, **Pelle**, and **Jakucionis** are all bound to have strong outings. Given the injuries, it is difficult to project that the **Cavs** will find any rhythm, making it hard to project **Jarrett Allen** to perform well – **under on PR**.

**Parlay 0.1u; +600; 7:30pm DK**

* **Allen U 16.5 pts**
* **Hunter 5+ 3s**

---

### HOU vs WAS (**HOU -17**)

**Okogie**, **Amen Thompson**, **Kevin Durant (KD)**, **Jabari Smith**, **Alperen Sengun**, **Reed**, **Tari Eason**, **Steven Adams**, **Clint Capela**
**CJ**, **Tre**, **Kyshawn**, **Khris**, **Sarr**, **Bub**, **Corey Kispert**, **Cam**, **Marvin Bagley**

No new notable injuries.

**Houston** should dogwalk the **Wizards**. Only good lines would be on **3+ Tre Johnson 3s** for garbage time stat padding. **Rockets** unders are likely already heavily priced in, though **KD** lines might be inflated due to stupid money. **Amen 4+ asts** seems viable though as they keep him running point for more reps.

Note: **Tre Johnson priced o/u 1.5 3s**, and **Amen o/u 5.5 asts**. Lines seem **soft for Tre** and **sharp for Amen**, though the reasoning still remains solid. Go **under on Amen assists** instead and lean into **Tre 3s**.

**Parlay 0.25u; +1200; 7:50pm DK**

* **Amen U 5.5 ast**
* **Tre 4+ 3s**

---

### NOP vs POR (**POR -8.5**)

Notable injuries to **Zion Williamson**, **Jordan Poole**, and regular injuries to **Portland**.

Portland look to retain their above-average standing. **Fears** and **Queen** will be asked to lead the **Pelicans**, with both receiving **10+ FGA**; **Deni Avdija** however will put up a stinker against **Trey Murphy** and **Herb Jones**. **Donovan Clingan** will be dominant on the glass though **Missi** and **Kevon Looney** will likely both put up strong numbers in terms of effort.

Without next year’s pick, the **Pels** have everything to lose, and thus **Fears** will be putting up **8+ 3FGA**, and **Queen** will be asked to hustle for everything.

Note on lines: everything mentioned seems to be heavily priced in, though **Avdija’s line seems soft**.

**Prop; 2u; -108; 7:55pm DK**
**Avdija U 24.5 pts**

---

### SAS vs GSW

No significant injuries.

**Will Richard** will be the standout player for the **Warriors** as other starters such as **Stephen Curry**, **Draymond Green**, **Al Horford**, and **Jimmy Butler** all show signs of age regression. **Buddy Hield** also has regressed his median outcomes significantly since last year.

**De’Aaron Fox**, **Stephon Castle**, **Victor Wembanyama (Wemby)**, and **Devin Vassell** will all evenly distribute their working loads, with role players such as **Champagnie**, **Luke Kornet**, **Jeremy Sochan**, and **Kelly Olynyk** providing tough defense against the Warriors. In such a close game, I expect **Draymond** to get highly involved all around, making his **PRA** appealing.

**Parlay; 1u; +236; 8pm DK**

* **Will Richard 17+ PR**
* **Draymond 18.5 PRA**

---

### DAL vs PHX (**PHX -2.5**)

Injuries to **Anthony Davis (AD)** and **Jalen Green**.

I believe that **Cooper Flagg** will have improved his playmaking skills; thus **over on assists** will be viable, underscoring his expanding role as a point guard. **Grayson Allen** had **40+ points** in a blowout last game, though I expect it to come down to earth a bit, necessitating that other role players step up such as **Ryan Dunn**.

**Parlay 2u; 8:30pm DK; +250**

* **Flagg O 3.5 ast**
* **Ryan Dunn O 12.5 PR**


---

### OKC vs LAL (**OKC -8.5**)

Injuries to **Luguentz Dort**, **Aaron Wiggins**.

I think the **Lakers** are much better than the spread projects. **Jake LaRavia** points over is extremely hot right now; **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA)** is guaranteed **30 points**, and **Luka** is bound for **3+ 3s** and **8+ ast**. **Rui Hachimura** may be in a breakout spot as his midrange game improves, and **Isaiah Hartenstein’s** defense is overrated.

**Parlay 2u; +2500; 8:40pm DK**

* **SGA O 31.5 pts**
* **Rui O 17.5 PR**
* **LaRavia 15+ pts**

---

### ATL vs SAC (**ATL -4.5**)

Injuries to **Trae Young** and **Zach LaVine**.

Looking at low floor high ceiling candidates, I see **Nique** and **Zaccharie Risacher** as obvious standouts. Since the game script means it will stay within **2 possessions**, I see little reason to bet on props involving the main players, e.g., **Dennis Schroder**, **DeMar DeRozan**, **Domantas Sabonis**, **Russell Westbrook**, etc. **Jalen Johnson** will likely look to distribute, contributing to his **assists**.

**0.25u Parlay; +600; 8:51pm DK**

* **Jalen Johnson O 13.5 RA**
* **Risacher 18+ pts**

---

### DEN vs LAC (**DEN -4.5**)

No **Bradley Beal**, **Kawhi Leonard**, and healthy **Nuggets**.

I think the **Clippers** are bound to let **James Harden** go iso for most of the game. Expecting a **monster performance** from him – as well as **foul trouble and exhaustion** for those guarding him, including **Cam Johnson**, **Christian Braun**, and **Jamal Murray**.

I think **Aaron Gordon** and **John Collins** will each have **7+ reb** as well given the boxout game between **Ivica Zubac (Zu)** and **Nikola Jokic**. And **Zu** looks to be playing his best basketball yet; I’d put **unders on Jokic**.

Thus **over on Harden points** as a standalone, and separate parlay for rest of props.

**Prop 1u; -123; DK; 9:50pm ET**
**Harden O 23.5 pts**

**Parlay 0.5u; +470; DK; 9:50pm ET**

* **John Collins 7+ reb**
* **Aaron Gordon 7+ reb**
