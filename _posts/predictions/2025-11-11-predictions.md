## TOR vs BKN (TOR -10.5)

Expecting MPJ to put up extremely high numbers; under on Claxton rebounds due to Raptors’ size; over on CMB, expecting 25+ minutes (though props unavailable on DraftKings due to Poeltl starting). Demin expected 20+ minutes, over on R+A. Expecting MPJ to overperform to keep the game close. Individual prop on PRA.

#### Parlay 1 — 0.25u, 5pm DK (+480)

* **Claxton U 8.5 REB**
* **Demin O 7.5 RA**
* **MPJ O 22.5 PTS**

#### Prop 1 — 0.25u, 5pm DK (+295)

**MPJ 40+ PRA**


## MEM vs NYK (NYK -9.5)

New York favored, but expecting a barrage of 3s from Grizzlies F/Cs to keep it close; Landale, Aldama, and Coward 3s keep the game tighter than expected. Thus Brunson PA remains viable in a close game; over RA of Ja in the expected facilitating PG role. Looking to keep Memphis in the game, expect 4–5 3PA from Jock Landale, with 2–3 likely hitting.

#### Parlay 2 — 0.1u, 5pm DK (+1100)

* **Brunson O 33.5 PA**
* **Morant O 11.5 RA**
* **Landale O 0.5 3PM**
* **Coward O 1.5 3PM**
* **Aldama O 1.5 3PM**

#### Prop 2 — 0.5u, 5pm DK (+190)

**Landale 2+ 3PM**



## BOS vs PHI (PHI -2.5)

76ers lack the wing stoppers to hold Brown on points; expecting extreme 3FG volume from 76ers guards, leading to defensive rebounding opportunities (Pritchard and Minott). Simons and Derrick White look to swing–swing as 76ers guards close out heavily.

#### Parlay 3 — 0.1u, 5pm DK (+2400)

* **Brown O 27.5 PTS**
* **Derrick White O 5.5 AST**
* **Simons O 2.5 AST**
* **Minott O 5.5 REB**
* **Pritchard O 4.5 REB**


## GSW vs OKC (OKC -7.5)

OKC heavily favored, though Curry is expected to play; expect a high level of involvement from Draymond (O PRA). Ajay Mitchell likely has trouble finding shots against an active Warriors defense, leading to more passes; Kuminga is asked to step up as well.

#### Parlay 4 — 0.25u, 5pm DK (+420)

* **Green O 19.5 PRA**
* **Kuminga O 23.5 PRA**
* **Ajay Mitchell O 3.5 AST**



## IND vs UTA (IND -2.5)

Nembhard looked fantastic upon return, though some shots didn’t fall; expecting a rebound performance. Ace’s shots look to be legit, and PRA looks enticing. Expect a huge performance by Siakam to keep the game script healthy.

#### Parlay 5 — **0.1u**, 5pm DK (+1000)

* **Nembhard O 26.5 PRA**
* **Bailey 25+ PRA**
* **Siakam O 33.5 PR**



## DEN vs SAC (DEN -8.5)

Expect a huge rebounding battle between wings/guards on both sides as Jokic and Sabonis keep each other glued under the basket; Schroder is poised for a bounce-back; expect Braun to have a physical edge over an aging Kings backcourt.

#### Parlay 6 — 0.1u, 5pm DK (+2800)

* **Gordon O 4.5 REB**
* **Christian Braun 25+ PRA**
* **Schroder O 1.5 3PM**
* **Schroder O 2.5 REB**
* **Murray O 3.5 REB**
