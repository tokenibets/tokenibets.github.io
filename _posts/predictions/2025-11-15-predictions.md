## MEM vs CLE

No Garland/Strus. CLE -11.5.

So, the obvious play would be to bet on 3s made props for Jock Landale, which had been underpriced given his new surge of shooting. But will the game script even warrant this outcome?

CLE is favored by several scores, and MEM looks to be on a downward trajectory. Though, the Grizzlies are still young. Cedric Coward, JJJ, Aldama, and even Ja are under 30 and many of them have yet to capitalize on their full potential. But the Cavs are one of the top teams in the east, though they have lost twice straight to the Raptors.

I think that the Raptors’ Poeltl was a key reason why Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley performed poorly in their game. I think that the Jock Landale will have similar positional size to Poeltl that Jarrett Allen and Mobley will have a tough time making shots in the paint.

On the other side, Coward and JJJ should possess the sheer athleticism and talent to shut down any of the Cavs’ other forwards, such as Hunter or Dean Wade. This means it will boil down to Donovan Mitchell, Craig Porter Jr., and Sam Merrill to exhibit strong guard play from the perimeter. 

The Grizzlies on the other hand are team without a solid direction. I am most bullish on Aldama and Coward, but to project them to have a break-out game against the Cavs, whose defenders in Wade, Allen, and Mobley are top of the league, is far-fetched. 

I think that Donovan Mitchell props are what make the most sense in this game. I would expect him also to positively regress to his mean 3PT%, whereas he has been in a slump as of late. However, it is also difficult to project his total props given that the game will likely be dictated by the Cavs early with a lead so large that it cannot be overcome. 

Aldama will probably find a way to stay on the floor 25 or so minutes, even in a blowout loss. In such a case, I think that 2+ 3s would be a play; he has also averaged almost 4 assists a game in the past three games. 

The props have Aldama 4+ assists at +201, and O/U at 2.5 ast, O 2.5 at -118. I am fairly confident that Aldama will be passing the ball fairly aggressively due to pressure from the defensively strong frontcourt in the Cavs– and swing-swing to Coward, Morant, JJJ, or Landale will remain completely viable throughout the game, even more so in a close matchup.

As a result, O 2.5 ast at 2-5u, and 6+ ast (+1000) at 0.1-0.5u in the tail outcome will be warranted as well. 



**PROP; 2u; -118; 4:55pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Santi Aldama O 2.5 assists**


**PROP; 0.25; +1000; 4:55pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Santi Aldama 6+ assists**






## OKC vs CHA (OKC -17.5)

Injuries Aaron Wiggins, Jay Will, J Dub; LaMelo, McNeeley, Miller

It’ll be Ajay Mitchell; SGA; Cason Wallace; Chet; Hartenstein; and then Isaiah Joe, Caruso, and others off the bench. The Hornets will run through Bridges, Knueppel, Sexton, Kalkbrenner, and a few others. 

If OKC are favored by such a huge margin, it’ll just mean that SGA gets his 30 and dips in the third quarter. I think that the only props that will be competitive are first quarter props; all others will likely fall short. 

I think the Thunder will just game plan for shutting down Knueppel. But more importantly, I think Kalkbrenner has a genuine physical edge over Chet or Hartenstein. As a result, I think going over on first quarter rebounds will be the best move here.
 


**PROP; 2u; -118; 4:55pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Santi Aldama O 2.5 assists**


## TOR vs IND

Nesmith, Mathurin, Toppin out; CMB healthy but props not offered.

I think that since CMB will be playing, and Nembhard provides good defense on the perimeter, the offense of the Raptors consolidates towards their wings who may struggle against Siakam. 

Nembhard, in having to carry the offensive load for the Pacers, will have to take several threes, and his mechanics are crisp enough that he can convert on more than his O/U which is set at 1.5.

Thus I think taking the under on the Raptors scoring machine in RJ Barrett will also be a move as he struggles to get to the rim against an underrated Pacers defense, and also capitalizing on his hot streak of scoring which I think is bound to regress.

**PROP; 2u; -118; 4:55pm ET DraftKings**

*  **Santi Aldama O 2.5 assists**
